# Matlab-Simulink-Projects-From-Scratch-

1. Generate, Display and Export Sine Waves.
2. Integration and differentiation in simulink (Time domain).
3. Mass Spring Damper system in time domain.(MSD)
4. Mass Spring Damper system in Laplace domain.
5. Battery model simulation (State of Charge/Open Circuit Voltage).
6. PID Controllers(Proportional Integral Derivative)(Time domain).
7. PID-MSD integrations.
8. PID tuning in S-domain.
9. Adaptive Cruise Control using m-script (Basic Implementation using P controller).
10. DC motor position control using PID.

If you wants short summary and step wise procedure to understand the above topics and their models/m scripts/theory , I have created small summary sheet at bottom.
Let me know if you need any assistance on topics mentioned by email.
